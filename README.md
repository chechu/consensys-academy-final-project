ConsenSys Academyâ€™s 2018 Developer Program Final Project

I'm using Uport Connect to make a simple (not production ready) integration with Uport, where the requests are signed in the Browser Application with a temporary (stored in the local storage) private key (for more info see https://developer.uport.me/uport-connect/reference/index#Connect+sendVerification)

## How did I remove an item from an indexed and unsorted array
Moving the last item of the array on the position of the item that I want to remove, and decrementing the length of the array. Inspired in https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract/blob/master/contracts/SuNFT.sol#L296.

According to this: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/39302 You don't need to delete explicitly using `delete array[index]`. It's enough with `array.length--`.

## Circuit breaker
The flag `stopped` is public, to allow to know if the contract is stopped or not from outside.
