ConsenSys Academyâ€™s 2018 Developer Program Final Project

I'm using Uport Connect to make a simple (not production ready) integration with Uport, where the requests are signed in the Browser Application with a temporary (stored in the local storage) private key (for more info see https://developer.uport.me/uport-connect/reference/index#Connect+sendVerification)

## How did I remove an item from an indexed and unsorted array
Moving the last item of the array on the position of the item that I want to remove, and decrementing the length of the array. Inspired in https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract/blob/master/contracts/SuNFT.sol#L296.

According to this: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/39302 You don't need to delete explicitly using `delete array[index]`. It's enough with `array.length--`.

## Circuit breaker
The flag `stopped` is public, to allow to know if the contract is stopped or not from outside.

## Design patterns
* Circuit breaker
* Withdrawal. https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts
* Restricting access, with roles and ownership. https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/common-patterns.html#restricting-access
* Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, to avoid re-entrancy, in the withdraw method.

### Gas limit and loops
Removing a store (method implemented in the contract but not in the web application), could generate a gas issue. To delete a store, the contract iterates on the associated items, removing it. If the number of items associated with the store would be too high, we could have a gas limit issue.

One solution could be to perform a logical remove, keeping the store in the contract's storage, but with a flag to ignore it form now on.

A better solution is to store the index in the store struct, and update it when the array is modified.

## Libraries
I'm using SafeMath, from OpenZeppeling project. The use is and edge case, increasing the pending funds, but it's just a demo of using a library.
